Project Title: Sentiment Analysis System using NLTK
Description:
This project implements a sentiment analysis system using Python's Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK). The system analyzes text data to determine the sentiment (positive, negative, or neutral) of the input.

Key Features:

Text preprocessing: Tokenization, lowercasing, and removal of stop words and punctuation

Feature extraction: Implementation of bag-of-words and TF-IDF techniques

Sentiment classification: Utilizes NLTK's pre-trained sentiment analyzer
Custom model comparison: Implements and compares Naive Bayes and Support Vector Machine classifiers
Aspect-based sentiment analysis: Identifies sentiment towards specific aspects or features in the text

Technologies Used:

Python
NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit)
Scikit-learn (for machine learning models)
Pandas (for data handling)

Performance:

Achieved 85% accuracy on a test dataset of product reviews
